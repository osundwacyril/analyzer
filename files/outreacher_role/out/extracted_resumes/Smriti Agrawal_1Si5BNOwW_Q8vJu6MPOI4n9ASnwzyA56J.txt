PROFILE
My nearly two years as a content writer and editor have provided me with a

diverse range of relevant experiences and challenges. While it's difficult to

isolate any one experience as the most formative, my time writing 150-word

real estate descriptions of builders taught me invaluable skills. The restrictive

word count forced me to hone my ability to synthesize key details and craft a

compelling narrative. By carefully choosing which details to highlight, I

learned how to capture readers' interest and convey the essence of a

property effectively. The experience fine-tuned my skill for identifying and

communicating only the most critical information needed to turn prospects

into potential buyers within a very limited space. I now apply these same

skills across a wide variety of content projects, allowing me to provide clients

with powerful copy that speaks to their audiences. Through the unique

challenges posed by different clients and subject matter over the past two

years, I've evolved as a more adaptable, discerning, and results-driven

content professional.
