Summary

SEO Outreach Manager | Link Building Specialist | White-Hat SEO

Link building | Expert in Genuine Backlink Acquisition

Hi, I’m Keerthana! Over the past year, I’ve driven remarkable

results in link building by acquiring 1,000+ high-quality backlinks for

clients across industries, particularly SaaS. I’m passionate about

ethical, white-hat SEO, focusing exclusively on genuine sites with

established services and a real team behind them. My dedication to

quality extends to the details; I meticulously avoid spammy sites and

PBNs to ensure each link I acquire adds lasting value for my clients.

Core Expertise

1. Manual Outreach & Link Exchange: Skilled in negotiating and

securing backlinks via personalized, direct outreach and white-hat

2. Quality-Driven Strategy: I prioritize genuine sites that show

authentic presence with strong “About Us” sections, focusing on real

engagement over volume.

3. Advanced Domain Analysis: I’ve created a comprehensive SOP

to evaluate quality domains through Ahrefs, targeting high-ROI links

and steering clear of domains with a spammy link profile.

4. Unique Approach: My approach to link-building is rooted in

transparency and a clear strategy. Using my formula to determine

site quality, I assess if a domain’s ratio of do-follow referring domains

to outgoing links is above 0.12 – a benchmark that helps identify

strong, reputable sites.
