PUBLICATIONS

Authored A Book (Khayaal - An Eternity)

2020  https://www.amazon.in/dp/1648995950

Immersing myself in the timeless works of poets such as William Shakespeare, John Keats, and Rudyard Kipling fueled my passion for poetry and

literature from a young age. I found inspiration in their words, prompting me to embark on my own journey as a writer at the tender age of 12. Writing
poetry became my preferred mode of self-expression, as I discovered the profound impact that carefully chosen words could have.

At 17, in the year 2020, I took a decisive step forward by consolidating my poetic endeavors into a singular achievement: my book titled "Khayaal- An
Eternity." This endeavor marked a pinnacle in my creative exploration, offering not only an outlet for expression but also an opportunity for personal
growth. Crafting this collection taught me invaluable lessons in writing techniques, literary principles, and the nuances of vocabulary. Moreover, it instilled

in me a profound sense of responsibility, as I navigated the process independently.

Delving into the depths of my thoughts and emotions during the creation of "Khayaal- An Eternity" challenged me to explore new depths of creativity and

introspection. Each word, each verse became a testament to the significance of every thought and the importance of translating them into tangible
creations. Through this experience, I learned that every idea holds value, and it is our duty to give it substance and meaning.

the development of ethics and empathy, reminding us of our responsibility to aid those in need.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Building peace, trust, honesty, and cooperation among nations is paramount. Additionally, crafting rules that address the root causes of injustice and

mistreatment is essential.

It's our duty to reform elements of the legal system from a global perspective, ensuring equal respect and fulfillment of promises for all individuals.
