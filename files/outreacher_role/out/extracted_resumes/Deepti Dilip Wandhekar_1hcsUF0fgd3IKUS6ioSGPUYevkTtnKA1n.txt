Key Skills:  Andriod Application   PHP   RFID   Bluetooth

The project titled " SMART CHART SHOPPING LIST" was based on the technology called RFID. Focusing the problem faced by the people while
shopping we introduced the software "Smart Chart-Shopping list". We introduced a trolley wherein their is a display screen, RFID READER.
Whenever customer buy a product, he has to scan the product by the RFID READER accordingly the product will be displayed on the LCD display
and on the application so created connected to the trolley. The Bluetooth module was used for transferring the data to main computer. Customer can
add or delete the multiple product from the application as per choice. Also he/she can set the budget for the shopping if it exceeds then the customer
is notified. Customer will also be navigated to the dedicated product using the application. Finally the total bill will be displayed to the customer,
accordingly the customer can choose the way he want to do payment. Thus these rugged system "Smart Chart-shopping list" helps the people to do
shopping effectively.

Encryption of Image Using Triple DES

Key Skills:  Python

The project was made to encrypt and decrypt the image with the help of triple Data Encryption Algorithm, Triple DES: Triple DES is a encryption
technique which uses three instance of DES on same plain text. It means, it first encrypts the data, decrypts the data, and again encrypt the data.
With this project I encrypted the image using key and when to access the image it is needed to decrypt the image again using the same key.

Malware Detection System
The project "Malware Detection System" was developed on the basis of study that nowadays Virus,malware etc are leading to loss of data and
financial loss. So the malware detection system was made by using mahine learning algorithm SVM to detect the malware in the software. Thus the
software helped to detect virus botnet by taking data of the system and then from the trained malware detection system it will predict the presence of
malware.

Desktop based Malware Detection System in Machine learning using Effective SVM
GOYA Journal
This paper specifies the project entitled "Malware detection System" that will predict the malware using machine learning algorithm - SVM. In now-a-
days, growth of internet users is increased day by day and online service app is also 
arise in market and here is suitable environment to perform cybercrimes. Malware is of different type for example Trojan, ransomware, worms,
spyware, adware etc.The project "Malware Detection System" was developed on the basis of study that nowadays Virus,malware etc are leading to

JETIR
The paper specifies the project titled "SMART CHART SHOPPING LIST" was developed using RDID , assisting people while shopping. The paper
describes about the RFID MODULE, the technology that has made many innovations. Introducing the software "Smart Chart-Shopping list" we
developed a trolley wherein their is a display screen, RFID READER and the application. Whenever customer buy a product, he has to scan the
product by the RFID READER accordingly the product will be displayed on the LCD display and the product is added in the chart in application. The
Bluetooth module is used for transferring the data to main computer. Customer will also be navigated to the dedicated product using the application.
Finally the total bill will be displayed to the customer, accordingly the customer can choose the way he want to do payment. Thus the paper briefs
about the working of the project and describes the technology "RFID".
