P R O F I L E
With over 6 years of hands-on experience in acquiring backlinks, building websites,
and flipping them for a profit, I have come a long way.

By leveraging my negotiation skills, I have secured authoritative backlinks in the
SaaS, health, and other niches for free or through barter deals.

With link building strategies like the skyscraper method and the broken link method,
I have acquired quality and relevant links from HiverHQ, RecruitCRM, Hubspot and
100+ other authoritative sites.

performance metrics, and conducted A/B testing to optimize strategies for
improved conversion and engagement.
