2020-2024 
Matriculated in 2020 in the height of the covid-19 pandemic. As the pandemic ended I 
competed in martial arts and began farming to generate income as well as tree felling and 
home maintenance jobs. 

I am currently employed as the manager of a homestead volunteer program and general 
farmhand, whilst maintaining all farming operations on our residential farm on a part time 
basis. I am extremely eager to be involved in digital marketing and have had an interest in it 
for an extended period. I thoroughly enjoyed the digital marketing course as well the SEO 
course and completed them before the end date while passing the exams with over 75%.
