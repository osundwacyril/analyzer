PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY 

During my 8-year stint in the academic sphere, teaching, mentoring, supervising, assessing, collaborating, designing, and 
overseeing  projects,  access,  processes,  and  activities  has  enhanced  my  ability  to  build  and  nurture  relationships. 
Furthermore,  as  a  professional  scientific  liaison  for  undergraduate  teams,  I  have  successfully  trained  medical,  nursing, 
optometry, biokinetics, physiotherapy, and dietetics students in anatomy and physiology concepts., I learned to identify 
unique  methods,  tools,  and  pedagogical  approaches  and  tailor  solutions  to  meet  the  needs  of  both  lecturers  and 
students. My consultative adeptness which is enriched by a circle of peers and experts in the academic sphere of teaching 
and research has deepened my capacity to effectively communicate, respond, educate, debate, brainstorm, and share 
information. I am looking for roles in which I will continue to provide high throughput and meaningful contributions through 
leadership, scholarship, and collaboration using updated practical manuals and virtual tools.
