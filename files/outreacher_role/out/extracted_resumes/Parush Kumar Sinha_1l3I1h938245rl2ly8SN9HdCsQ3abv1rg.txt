Experience

Banao Technologies
Product Manager
December 2022 - Present (1 year 3 months)

I’ve had the privilege of leading a dynamic team of content writers, graphic

designers, and social media managers across multiple projects. My experience

encompasses a variety of departments, including finance, marketing, HR, and

design.

I’ve contributed significantly to a variety of initiatives such as Kalp Nutrition,

Limelight, and EdTech ATG. A notable achievement was my role in a toy-

selling company where I was instrumental in driving sales from inception.

In the EdTech project, I successfully boosted sales with the assistance of field

marketers. My skill set also includes inventory management, a competency

that I acquired during my tenure. This expertise extends to assisting with GST

filing procedures.

Significant achievement was my role in a toy-selling company. Here, I not

only drove sales from its inception but also significantly boosted online sales.

Working collaboratively with a dedicated team, I focused on SEO and digital

marketing strategies, which were instrumental in driving sales via the website.

This experience has further enriched my skill set and understanding of the

digital marketplace.

My multifaceted experience and skills make me a versatile professional, ready

to take on new challenges.
