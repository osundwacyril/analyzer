PROJECTS

DIFFERNTIAL LOCKING UNIT SYSTEM, 213 Days

A locking differential is designed to overcome the chief
limitation of a standard open differential by essentially
"locking" both wheels on an axle together as if on a
common shaft. This forces both wheels to turn in unison,
regardless of the traction (or lack thereof) available to
either wheel individually.
