Non- Degree

➢After graduating as a Dental Surgeon in 2012, I studied and strengthened my concepts,
for working as a Zoology faculty in Coaching Institutes for pre-medical entrance
examinations. I got selected in Aakash Institute. However, I started preparing for Indian
examinations conducted by UPSC. Despite failures, the
Administrative Service (IAS)
journey was very constructive and transformative for me. Because, studying such vast
range of topics in an extensive manner, on a daily basis, I learned working on analytical
study of various subjects, starting from basic level as NCERT’s from class 6th to 12th and
inter-linking the basic information with current affairs on a regular basis. This helped
holistic understanding of concepts and made me even more inclined to get ahead with
Writing and language-oriented jobs.

➢TEACHING & WRITING EXPERIENCE: In need-based circumstances, I have taught
students ranging from 6-7th class to 10th, 11th and 12th Boards, especially conducting
doubt-solving sessions, explaining tough topics in a lucid way and discussing questions
and answer-writing in the most “marks-fetching” manner.

➢MY IDEA: My Idea of fetching marks in education or getting customers in the real world,
has been through use of powerful words, use of graphic methods and easy to understand
but fluent and formal language.
