Qualifications and Experience as an Amateur Artist 
Diploma from All India Fine Arts Association (3rd year). 
Participated and qualified in Shimul International Painting Challenge in December 2009 for 
Contemporary Painting (Acrylic). 
About an artist – rediscovering myself It was a hoarding displayed opposite of Science City that 
caught my mind, rather the word ‘Your Painting’. I can’t express how it works, but can confess that 
it compelled me to brush up my brush after ten long years. I have never thought before that the 
word ‘Painting’ can make me that amount of “really crazy” that I have never been before. I 
always love to enjoy good art works, painting is one of my favorite hobbies, but after 11th 
December 2009, 2:40 a.m. after the completion of the painting ‘Solitude’ I realized that it is more 
than a ‘hobby’ and my professional career also. This is ‘PASSION’ — ‘my own PASSION’. I 
rediscovered myself. Thanks a ton to ‘Shimul’ for searching me, to whom I have lost in past years, to 
myself.
