Malik Aqeel

SEO | Proficient in Outreach Link Building and Guest Posting
Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan

Summary

As a Link Builder and guest Post Specialist, I work with a talented

team to build high-quality and relevant backlinks for various

clients, such as Addmotor.com, Tiktokio.com, Lumbuy.com, and

many others. We use strategic link-building techniques, content

marketing, guest posting, email outreach, and blogging to enhance

the websites' search engine rankings, authority, and online visibility.

I have two years of hands-on experience in link-building and SEO,

and I am proficient in fundamental link-building strategies and

possess strong outreach and communication skills. I have completed

multiple courses and certifications from LinkedIn and Udemy, which

have equipped me with the latest skills and knowledge in the link-

building and SEO industry. 

Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science

from Virtual University, which will help me to further develop my

technical and analytical skills. I enjoy collaborating with other link

builders and SEO specialists as a team player, and I am committed

to staying updated on the latest industry trends and best practices.

I am open to working on link-building projects, as well as remote

link-building roles, to broaden my experience and contribute to the
success of the clients. So, if you are seeking a link builder with skills

and experience, please feel free to get in touch with me or DM me on

Skype.
