Pragya Singhal 
Content writer 
I like to put a lot of my emotions, experiences, and opinions into what I write. I like being able to make my
writing something other people can connect to, or relate to in some way by generalizing the thoughts
and experiences I'm writing about. I believe I have a strong relationship with the words which makes it
easier to write creative content.
