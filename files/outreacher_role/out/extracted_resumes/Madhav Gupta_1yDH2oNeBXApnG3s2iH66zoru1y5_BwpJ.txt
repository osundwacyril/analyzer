 I am writing to express my interest in graphic designing or in it sector.  I come from a solid technical
background with a strong interest in business and a passion towards strategy. My area of focus and
interest varies from quantitative analysis to project management. I have maintained a 8.96 GPA through
a well-balanced program of study, which is not only very analytical and technical by nature but also
helps to build leadership and team building qualities. I am extremely impressed with company’s

approach to strategy consulting, especially within the Business Development and Innovation practice
areas. I believe my academic background, it knowledge and industry experiences have provided me
with the credentials needed to thrive as an Associate.

Prior to js tech Flux , I worked as graphic designer  primarily resolving strategic issues related to
technology process improvement. I gained solid research, analytical and problem solving skills while
working in Fortune companies. My background in generating innovative ideas and strategies to improve
processes has provided me with a deeper understanding of multifaceted problems that companies
encounter in their daily operations. Moreover, because of my work experiences, I fully understand how

important it is to have great team dynamics in today’s multi-disciplinary business environment.

To date, my experience as an IT professional has been extremely rewarding and productive. However, it
is through strategy consulting that I can use my analytical aptitude and creative problem solving skills
to their fullest. I strongly believe that consulting is a discipline that will force me to view problems not
only from the client’s standpoint but also from a marketplace, best practices and “think out of the box”
point of views.

I would appreciate the opportunity to interview with you for the Associate position. Please ﬁnd

enclosed my resume for your review. I can be reached via email at mg0520244@gmail.com or by phone
at 9084927797. I enthusiastically look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely 

Madhav Gupta
