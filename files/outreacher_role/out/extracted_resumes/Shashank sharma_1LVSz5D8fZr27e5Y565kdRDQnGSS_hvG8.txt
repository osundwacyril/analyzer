Recent Projects
WEBSITE FOR PLANT DISEASE DETECTION SYSTEM
Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai
 Sep 2022 ‑ Nov 2022
 Chennai, India
A project under the Vellore Institute of Technology in which I built a plant
disease detection system using machine learning (ML) as a backend and
flask framework as a frontend. In this scenario, the ML backend will be
responsible for processing and analyzing images of plant leaves to identify
potential diseases, while the frontend will provide a user‑friendly interface
for interacting with the system.
AGE AND GENDER DETECTION USING NEURAL NETWORKS
Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai
 Chennai, India
 August 2023 ‑ November 2023
A project under the Vellore Institute of Technology in which I Developed a
robust age and gender detection system using Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) and transfer learning with pre‑trained models (ResNet50,
VGG16, InceptionV3). Engineered data preprocessing, fine‑tuning, and
model deployment for real‑time image‑based predictions. Achieved
accurate results through comprehensive training on a diverse dataset,
showcasing proficiency in computer vision and deep learning.
NEWS SCRAPING, CLASSIFICATION, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
AND SUMMARISATION
Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai
 Jan 2022 ‑ April 2022
 Chennai, India
A project under the Vellore Institute of Technology, to classify news
according to the sentiment they represent(Positive, Neutral, Negative)
using various machine learning algorithms and classify them into the
categories they fall into. Finally, for user convenience, I Summarized the
news articles using word2vec and seq2seq models. The dataset for the
project was scraped using Beautifulsoup library of python.
PHISHING WEBSITE DETECTION SYSTEM
Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai
 Jan 2023 ‑ April 2023
 Chennai, India
A project under the Vellore Institute of Technology is to train machine
learning models and deep neural nets on the dataset created to predict
phishing websites. Both phishing and benign URLs of websites are
gathered to form a dataset and from them required URL and website
content‑based features are extracted. The performance level of each
model is measured.
