PROJECTS 

E â€“ Pilots: A system to predict hard landing 

Hard landing prediction using LSTM algorithms aims to enhance flight safety by predicting potential hard 
landings, which can lead to plane crashes. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent 
neural network (RNN), are well-suited for this task due to their ability to process and learn from sequential 
data. By analyzing historical flight data, including parameters like speed, altitude, and descent rate, LSTM 
algorithms can identify patterns and predict the likelihood of a hard landing. Early predictions allow pilots 
and automated systems to take corrective actions, thus reducing the risk of accidents during the critical 
landing phase of a flight. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NJAC Editor 

An online code editor is a web-based tool that allows developers to write, edit, and execute code directly 
in  their  browser.  It  supports  multiple  programming  languages  and  provides  features  such  as  syntax 
highlighting,  auto-completion,  and  real-time  collaboration.  Users  can  save  their  code  snippets  and 
projects in the cloud, ensuring easy access and version control. Additionally, many online code editors 
integrate with various development tools and platforms, enhancing productivity and workflow efficiency. 

ACCOMPLISHMENTS & CERTIFICATIONS 

Career Essentials in Generative AI by Microsoft and LinkedIn 

Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that creates content such as text, images, audio, or video 
based  on  input  data  or  prompts.  It  uses  advanced  machine  learning  models,  like  neural  networks,  to 
generate  realistic  and  contextually  relevant  outputs,  enabling  applications  in  creative  industries, 
automation, and personalized experiences. 

Technical seminar on TECHNOLOGY OF HOLOGRAM 

The seminar on "Technology of Holograms" delves into the fascinating world of holography, exploring its 
principles, advancements, and applications. Attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of how 
holograms are created using the interference and diffraction of light to produce three-dimensional images. 
The  seminar  will  cover  the  evolution  of  holographic  technology,  from  its  theoretical  foundations  to 
modern innovations such as digital and augmented reality holography. Practical applications in fields like 
entertainment, medical imaging, security, and data storage will be discussed. Participants will also have 
the  opportunity  to  see  live  demonstrations  and  explore  future  trends  and  possibilities  in  holographic 
technology. 

HOBBIES & INTERESTS

My hobbies include engaging with communities on Discord, playing cricket, and coding. On Discord, I enjoy 
participating in various servers, connecting with like-minded individuals, and discussing topics of shared 
interest. Cricket is a passion of mine, both playing and watching, as it offers a perfect blend of strategy, 
teamwork,  and  physical  activity.  Additionally,  I  love  coding  because  it  allows  me  to  solve  problems 
creatively and continuously learn new technologies. These hobbies not only provide me with relaxation 
and enjoyment but also help me develop valuable skills and foster connections with others.
