Tatum is an absolute charm to work with and has a natural manner that makes her the perfect

glue in any team. I've managed Tatum for more than two and a half years, and her knowledge of

the omnichannel marketing mix means that she produces content that is SEO first and leads to

higher conversion rates. She's always thinking about how what she does today will impact cross-

functionally and that makes her invaluable to our marketing ROI.

RICK HARRINGTON| MARKETING MANAGER

Tatum-Lee joined the team with the daunting task of turning the company's lackluster SEO efforts

around; a task she more than achieved. Her hard work and focus resulted in massive improvements

in our organic acquisition and entirely changed the way the company approached marketing targets.

A great person and team member, she is a vital part of the marketing team.

ANDREW BRIDGE | MARKETING MANAGER- AFRICAN BUSH CAMPS

I recruited Tatum to be on my team at the beginning of the pandemic after our Jobs were affected in

the company we both worked for at the time, because it was in the travel industry. She was a vital

part of my team and stayed on even after I left the position. She has gone on to learn more hands-on

SEO work in some of the most competitive niches (finance) testing out the latest SEO techniques,

link building techniques and taking on content strategy head on. She has gone from being a good

soldier under a team leader and taking directions to being able to head up strategy, linking building

and content strategy as the lead SEO.

EUGENE MADONDO | SEO & LEAD GENERATION SPECIALIST  

I loved working with Tatum at Fetola. She was not only reliable and dependable in the delivery of

her project assistance, but also wholehearted, engaged and went the extra mile to research content

and offer useful perspectives. Tatum also has a fabulous eye for detail and a passion for language.‚Äù 

AMANDA DINAN | SUSTAINABILITY MANAGER - FETOLA

Tatum really is an asset to anyone who's team she's in. In 2015/16, I was a Senior Content

Producer and editorial mentor at Livity Africa and was always impressed with both the quality of

Tatum's work and her adherence to deadlines. An asset to any employer.
