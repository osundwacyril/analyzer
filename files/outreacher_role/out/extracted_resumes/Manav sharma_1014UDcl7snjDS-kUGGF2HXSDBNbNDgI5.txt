ANSWERING QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE

Q. Why Content Writing/ Copywriting when I Have Law as My Degree?

Driven by a deep-rooted passion for writing and music since the age of 12, I consciously chose to
pursue a career in content writing and copywriting. Despite briefly exploring law due to familial
influence, I quickly recognized it wasn't my true calling. Embracing my genuine passion, I ventured into
content writing and haven't looked back. With an impeccable attendance record spanning over 3 years,
I am wholeheartedly dedicated to my craft, constantly seeking growth and aiming to make a positive
impact through my writing every single day.

Q. Am I looking for a Long term Role In the content writing field? Or Do I look forward to a
career in writing only?

Yes, I am actively seeking a long-term role in the content writing field. Writing has always been my
passion, and I am committed to building a successful career in this field. I thrive on the opportunity to
create impactful and engaging content, and I am excited to continue honing my skills and making a
significant contribution to the writing industry.

Q. How Do I Plan to beat the AI in writing and providing something superior?

To surpass AI in writing and deliver superior content, my approach is comprehensive. I conduct
extensive research, gathering unique insights from diverse sources to create authentic and observational
content that goes beyond AI-generated suggestions. By strategically incorporating subheadings and
covering less-explored topics, I stay ahead of AI and cater to evolving reader demands, aligning with
Google's preference for fresh and original content. Additionally, since AI-generated content is frowned
upon by ranking algorithms, I gain a competitive advantage.
