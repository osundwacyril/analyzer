Hello, I’m Mayank Shekhar Puranmalka. 

I completed my B.Tech from Radha Govind Engineering 
College, Meerut affiliated to Dr A.P.J.Abdul Kalam 
Technical University, Lucknow in 2014-18 and I had 
been practicing/working as a civil engineer for the past 
3 years. 

I’ve previously worked for Cherrywood Interiors 
company for two years. 

I am interested in joining your company as an 
assistant civil engineer. Previously, I’ve worked on 
the construction of many multi-specialty projects. All 
the projects were led by Mr. 
Imran Khan, and I was his assistant civil engineer So, 
I am well versed in the tasks and I hold a good 
experience of what I am supposed to do as an 
assistant civil engineer 

My interests include reading articles about how certain 
complicated designed buildings were made. I read and 
watch videos that explain the tips and tricks which are 
applied to construct any project. Besides this, I like to 
read self- improvement books which help me improve 
more like a human. I was always interested in visiting 
places that have complex designs built. And that is why 
I took up civil engineering so that I could understand 
howcertain ideas come into existence. 

Thank You
