Research Experience

I have worked on two research projects based on linguistics under the guidance of Dr. Udoyan Banerji (Banaras
Hindu University, BHU): “Diglossia, cross‑cultural phenomena, and language contact in the Asansol industrial
area—a sociolinguistics view” and “Phonological peculiarities of Bengali radio journalists vis‑à‑vis the standard
colloquial Bangla as spoken in Kolkata”.

The first one focused on the language dynamics that exist in an industrial area in Asansol, India. The linguistic
landscape of this urban centre is heterogeneous, as evidenced not only by the coexistence of multiple languages,
such as Bengali, English, and Hindi, but also by the persistent use of different dialects of both Bengali and Hindi by
its inhabitants. In this project, diglossia, morphemic fluctuations, vocalic assimilation, borrowing phenomena,
instances of code‑switching and code‑mixing, as well as cultural blending, were observed and defined, estab‑
lishing these findings with proper case studies and examples. The linguistic prestige patterns that exist between
regional dialects and the mainstream Bengali language were examined. During the fieldwork, the interview pro‑
cess provided a deeper understanding of the psychology underlying people’s language use, illuminating the ways
in which language functions as a medium for social prestige, beside other linguistic characteristics. The circum‑
stances under which the phenomenon of linguistic prestige continues to exist between generations and the sit‑
uation under which it ends have also been discussed in this project.

In the second study, the intonation patterns of radio journalists, which resemble those of the dominant Hindi
and global English languages, were compared to those of standard Bangla. According to their archetypal conver‑
sation, code mixing, a tendency to pronounce fricatives in place of [p], using [ɽ] instead of [r] in certain situations,
and direct morphological translation from Hindi to Bangla were identified. The goal of this investigation topic
was to gain an understanding of the language pattern and its effect on modern society.

Professional Background

Worked as a teaching assistant: I was part of a guiding programme for bachelor’s degree students. Almost
one and a half years into my master’s degree curriculum, I taught around fifty‑five prospective students, a pe‑
riod defined by significant learning and progress. The method of teaching included using Bengali and English
as the primary languages of instruction. Our methodology of instruction was divided into two parts: 1) subject

expertise; and 2) strategic application process. Apart from a thorough understanding of the subject matter, as in‑
dicated by the examination components involving mathematical aptitude, the interpretation of unseen English
texts, and the expression of answers in the Bengali question‑answer sections, effective strategy implementation
is crucial for such severe competition. During this period, not only students gained benefits, but I also learned
time management and methodology for teaching according to students’ needs.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I have been a very active participant in extracurricular activities. I have
taken on the role of an organiser for cultural programmes since my school days and have been honoured with
many certificates. Every year, I used to instruct singing, dancing, and painting to my classmates, juniors, and

get opportunities to collaborate in academic, professional, and cultural activities in the same way, which will
broaden my experience globally.
