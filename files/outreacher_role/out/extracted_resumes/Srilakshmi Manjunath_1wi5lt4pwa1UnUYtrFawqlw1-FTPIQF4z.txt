Project Intern 
  Successfully contributed to the Structural Biology Team, working full time on Protein Crystallization and 3D     
structure determination and refinement of purified Protein. 

January 2017 – May 2017 

  Protein Crystallization 

●  Crystallization of protein through vapor diffusion method, sitting and hanging drop. 
●  Seeding Techniques, macro and micro seeding to enhance the crystallization. 
●  Screening experiments for identifying the crystal condition for an unknown protein and optimization of 

crystallization condition. 

●  Preparation of crystallization reagents

A contract Research and Innovation Service provider with ~ 861 employees providing drug and new product 
development and manufacture with biology and chemistry based products and services. 
Scientist Trainee 
Worked on project entitled, “Antibacterial and Antifungal activities of Rhamnolipid.” 
Description: In the study, Rhamnolipid was extracted from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Antibacterial studies were 
conducted against 20 different species of Bacterium. The molecule was also found to have Anti- Candida and Anti- 
Malasezzia properties.  PH and Temperature stability check was also conducted for the compound. 

May 2014 – December2014
