RESPONSIBILITY

Tinka Tinka Foundation, Delhi

Internship • Jul 2020  Sep 2020 3 months)

During the course of my internship at Tinka Tinka Foundation,
I had acquired technical skills of website management on
WordPress and blog management on Blogger. I had also
actively contributed to the Research team in all possible
projects.

I was selected to be a part of LSR Journalism department's
Content team for the Annual Academic Meet Juxtapose in my
first year of college. This gave me an opportunity to show my
skills of adhering to strict deadlines yet inking my creative
best.

I was chosen to be a part of my school's Student Council
team, for maintaining discipline and being a medium between
students and teacher body. I remained as a Prefect in school's
discipline committee during my high school days.

I was an active and chosen member of my school Faith
Academy's Editorial team. I worked tirelessly writing articles,
editing others and deciding on how to present them in a
visually appealing manner.

I had headed the Media team of my college LSR's Hindi
Creative Writing Society Abhivyakti. I not only expanded my
digital knowledge but also helped members of the team learn
skills of digital poster making, photography and videography.

I had also headed (unofficially) the Participant Affairs team
during the days of my department's Annual Academic Meet
Juxtapose, when few days before the event an urgent need
popped. My initiative helped me earn letter of appreciation
too.

I was the Sub-Editor of my department's Editorial team at
College level. Contributing articles, proof reading and editing
some, while also posting content online. I love writing, be it
creative, fashion or a different form like poems!

Fashion And Personal Styling

London School Of Trends, Online

May 2021  Sep 2021

I have successfully completed a Fashion and Personal Styling
online course from LST. My keen interest in dressing up,
styling, following trends had driven me to carry forward this
learning. The art of fashion is something ever changing, new
trends come up with every new sunrise and change by every
setting Sun. Discovering your signature style is in itself a life
changing experience. Having enough understanding of style
or taking someone's help to look the real you is a must. I feel
your look should be able to speak of you as a human.
Thus, I loved this course and its completion lead me to new
gateways of knowledge.
