RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
Research Assistant
Brauer Group Lab, University of Wisconsin-Madison
• I actively contributed as a research assistant in a team dedicated to investigating group phenomena and
their impact on individuals' thought processes, perceptions, and behaviors within social categories.
• Assisted in conducting research on diversity-related issues, specifically exploring the cognitive
processes involved in the maintenance of stereotypes and prejudice within different social groups.
• Played a key role in designing and implementing interventions aimed at reducing discrimination and
promoting diversity in various settings, such as schools and companies, while actively assessing the
effectiveness of these interventions.
• Conducted extensive literature reviews to gather relevant research articles, ensuring a comprehensive
understanding of existing knowledge and informing the team's research design and methodology.
Conducted qualitative analysis and quantitatively analyzed the data, identifying trends in behavior and
communication between individuals in the group.
• Collaborated with team members in running studies and working with participants, including
recruiting, scheduling, and facilitating experimental protocols, while maintaining strict confidentiality
protocols.
• Demonstrated strong organizational skills by effectively handling multiple projects simultaneously,
managing priorities, and coordinating tasks to ensure timely completion of research objectives.
• I attended and actively participated in lab meetings, sharing research updates and insights and
contributing to discussions on experimental design, data analysis, and future directions.

Research Assistant
Mindful of Memory lab, Department of Psychology, UW-Milwaukee September 2021 - May 2022
• Attend and actively contribute to scheduled laboratory meetings, demonstrating proficiency in
facilitating and
leading discussions centered around extant research findings.
• Employ critical analysis and insight to foster an environment conducive to scholarly discourse,
ensuring that discussions propel the research agenda forward.
• Assume a pivotal role in the execution of rigorous eye-tracking experiments, encompassing
multifaceted responsibilities. These encompass interfacing with study participants, securing informed
consent, orchestrating the experimental protocols, and adeptly troubleshooting any intricacies associated
with the eye-tracking apparatus.

rigor.

Research paper: Effects of Commitment on Inclusive Behavior
Brauer Group Lab, UW-Madison
• The study was aimed at determining to what extent utilizing one’s need for commitment and
consistency has an
effect on inclusive behavior change.
• The study measures the likelihood of a person agreeing to an inclusive behavior (recording a short
video with a message about diversity) in three different conditions: survey conditions (with and without
commitment) and a control condition.
• We predicted that participants in the non-control conditions would display more inclusive behavior by
saying “yes” to the video than those in the control, and those in the commitment condition would be
more likely to agree than those in the no commitment condition.
• Significantly more agreed to the video in the commitment condition than in the no commitment
condition, supporting our second hypothesis. However, our first hypothesis was not supported.
• These results suggest that explicit commitments to inclusion increase the likelihood of agreeing to a
commitment-consistent request, but it may not be more effective than asking people upfront to perform
an inclusive behavior.

January 2023 - Present

Research paper: The Effects of Inducing Guilt and Responsibility on White Undergraduates'
Behavioral Intentions
Brauer Group Lab, UW-Madison
• I am currently working on a study that aims to determine the respective effects of guilt and collective
responsibility on increasing anti-racist behavioral intentions.
• The current proposal aims to evaluate the effects of guilt and responsibility separately, suggesting that
the negative feelings of guilt in and of themselves do not lead to increased pro-social behavior, but
rather that the emphasis on collective responsibility is what promotes anti-racist behavior.
• The study also aims to measure pluralistic ignorance and how that relates to anti-racist behavioral
intentions. Pluralistic ignorance refers to the social psychology phenomenon where people hold a certain
belief but publicly display support for another belief or norm because they falsely believe that this is
what is more generally accepted by other people.
• Relatedly, this study will: 1) evaluate the efficacy of increasing anti-racist behavior through inducing
guilt; 2) evaluate the efficacy of increasing anti-racist behavior through inducing collective
responsibility; and 3) evaluate the association between pluralistic ignorance and anti-racist behavioral
intentions.
• Awaiting IRB approval
