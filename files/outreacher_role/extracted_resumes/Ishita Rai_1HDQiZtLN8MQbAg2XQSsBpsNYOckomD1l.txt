ISHITA RAI

S t u d e n t

While others want to handle the flashy cases that make the news, I want to help people who have
not  been  given  a  fair  chance  in  the  society.  I  am  currently  a  third  year  law  student  pursuing  law
from  Bennett  University.  I  hope  my  philosophy  and  skills  will  lead  to  greater  sense  of  social
equality in the society.
