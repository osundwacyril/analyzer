Objective Statement  

I am an associate designate, awaiting admission.  

I worked in the Intellectual Property department at Norton Rose Fulbright South Africa Inc, based 
in the Durban office.   

I completed my articles of clerkship at Norton Rose Fulbright South Africa Inc, Sandton, 
Johannesburg between 2021 – 2022. Having completed three core rotations, I have experience 
and exposure in Intellectual Property, Insurance, Medical Negligence and Commercial Litigation. 
I was subsequently retained in the Intellectual Property department, where I previously served a 
12-month rotation in 2022.   

I gained exposure and experience in both trademark prosecution and intellectual property 
disputes. I assisted with IP disputes, copyright infringements, takedowns, notices, letters of 
demand, licensing and assignment agreements, advisory on the protection of intellectual 
property, assistance with infringements thereof and due diligences. I also assisted with trademark 
portfolio management.   

I have worked with various clients such as SABC, Honor, Afrisam and Continental Food Brands 
to mention a few.   

I am a young, talented and hardworking attorney awaiting admission, who is driven to deliver 
results. I am innovative, solution resolutive and I think out of the box, which allows me to offer a 
transformative touch to the legal profession. I am able to work independently and require 
minimum supervision. I am efficient and work well under pressure. 

I hold a BA and LLB from the University of the Witwatersrand. I have completed and passed the 
Trade mark examination with South African Institute of Intellectual Property Law (SAIIPL) in 
September 2023. I intend taking the copyright exam and completing the Group One 
examinations.
