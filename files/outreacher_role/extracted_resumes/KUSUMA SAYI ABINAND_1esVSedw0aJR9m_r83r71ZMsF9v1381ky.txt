Pharmacy Management System
Using Python and MySQL

•The  Python-based  Pharmacy  Management  System  is  a  comprehensive  software  solution  that  streamlines 
various aspects of pharmacy operations. It enables efficient management of inventory, sales, prescriptions, 
and  customer  records.  With  intuitive  interfaces  and  automated  functionalities,  it  enhances  accuracy, 
reduces manual effort, and optimizes overall workflow in a pharmacy setting.

Inventory Management System
Using Python and MySQL

•An inventory management system in Python allows businesses to track and manage their stock efficiently. It 
provides  features  like  adding/updating  inventory  items,  monitoring  stock  levels,  generating  reports,  and 
alerting for low stock. It helps streamline operations and prevent stockouts or excess inventory.

Bank Management System
Using Python and SQLite

•A  bank  management  system  in  Python  enables  efficient  management  of  banking  operations.  It  includes 
features  like  customer  account  management,  transaction  processing,  loan  management,  and  reporting. 
With  user-friendly  interfaces,  it  ensures  secure  access,  data  integrity,  and  effective  control  over  banking 
activities.

Taxi Booking
Using Python and SQLite

•A taxi booking system in Python facilitates the process of reserving and managing taxi rides. It allows users 
to request a taxi, view available drivers, track the status of their ride, calculate fares, and generate invoices. 
The system enhances convenience and efficiency in taxi service operations.

Strain Analysis Based On Eye Blinking
using Python

•Strain  analysis  based  on  eye  blinking  in  Python  involves  analyzing  patterns  of  eye  blinks  to  assess  and 
monitor  individuals'  strain  levels.  By  measuring  blink  frequency  and  duration,  the  system  can  provide 
insights  into  fatigue  and  stress  levels,  aiding  in  the  identification  and  management  of  potential  strain-
related issues.

Medical cost regression
using machine learning

•Disease  prediction  and  cost  estimation  in  Python  involves  developing  a  model  to  predict  the  likelihood  of 
individuals developing certain diseases based on various factors. Additionally, the system can estimate the 
potential  costs  associated  with  the  disease,  aiding  in  healthcare  planning  and  resource  allocation  for 
effective disease management.

Advanced Healthcare System
Using Machine Learning

•I developed a Disease Prediction System using machine learning techniques during a personal project. The 
system utilizes SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classifiers to predict diseases based on user-selected 
symptoms.  I  also  implemented  an  ensemble  technique  to  combine  individual  model  predictions  for 
improved  accuracy.  The  project  involved  data  preprocessing,  model  training,  and  GUI  development  using 
Tkinter.  This  project  allowed  me  to  enhance  my  skills  in  data  analysis,  machine  learning,  and  software 
development, and it showcases my ability to create practical solutions using data-driven approaches.

WORKSHOPS AND BOOTCAMPS

•Attended Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning conducted in college

•Attended Bootcamp on Web Development

•Participated in five days Bootcamp on Ethical Hacking and CyberSecurity followed by one day hackathon in 
association with Supraja Technologies

•Attended Workshop on Cyber Security conducted by skill vertex

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Intern
InternPe

•During  my  internship,  I  had  the  opportunity  to  work  on  various  exciting  projects  that  allowed  me  to 
strengthen  my  programming  skills  and  creativity.  One  of  my  major  achievements  was  developing  a  fully 
functional  game  of  Tic  Tac  Toe,  implementing  logic  and  user-friendly  interfaces  to  enhance  the  gaming 
experience.  Additionally,  I  successfully  designed  and  coded  a  digital  clock  application  that  displayed 
accurate  time  with  different  time  zone  options,  showcasing  my  proficiency  in  time  handling.  Moreover,  I 
took on the challenge of creating a system shutdown application using tkinter and buttons, providing users 
with  a  convenient  and  direct  method  to  power  off  their  systems.  These  projects  not  only  sharpened  my 
problem-solving abilities but also gave me valuable insights into GUI development and user interaction.
