E D U C A T I O N  

Currently a student of Journalism, I

am looking forward to working in the

media industry. As a postgraduate

media student, I have developed the

skills of Photoshop and gained more

insight into media trends. My

Bachelor's degree in English has

helped me hone my vocabulary and

indulge in intellectually enriching

experiences. Being in the Student

Council at my College has given me an

edge over my peers, encouraging me

to improve my relational and

communication skills while organising

events at college and coordinating

with numerous people for the same.
