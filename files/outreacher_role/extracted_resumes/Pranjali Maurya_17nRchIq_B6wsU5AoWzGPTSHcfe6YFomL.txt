I am a graduate with a degree in computer science engineering from AKTU, Lucknow. During
my college days, I came across a platform that allowed students like me to earn while studying
at the same time in the form of internships. I applied for my first internship as a content
specialist at Urban company and to my surprise, I was selected. I applied for this internship
because it was something that I could do easily and have fun doing so. Then again during
summer breaks after my 4th semester, I applied for an internship with OYO as a content writer
and was able to crack it. This time it was different because I was given way more to do and I
was the only intern on the team. Covid happened in 2020 and I graduated. It was not easy for
me to crack a job offer of my liking till July 2020. My manager from OYO contacted me and
offered me an opportunity in her own start-up called Brahma Wellness as a Lead- Intern. I had 3
interns working under me. Together, we 4 were responsible for managing the brand’s different
social media channels. I ideated and created creatives along with them. I was able to go from
56 to 1200+ organic followers on Brahma wellness’s Instagram page. On Pinterest, from 0 to
200+ clicks on a single pin. 2020 was the year that changed my life forever because I thought if
there was no job available in the market for me then I should create one for myself. I started a
group called Bodh India where I would take a group of people to different offbeat places across
Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh at a very affordable price. I gave business to the local
small-scale business owners from these places whose businesses were affected by covid-19. It
was a win-win situation for everyone as I got to make a small commission by giving business to
the local business owners and traveled for free, people who wanted to travel to different places
but couldn’t afford it were able to travel because the itineraries were cheap and the small scale
business owners made money as well. Things were going well but it's not something that you
can do all the time. I have experienced digital marketing/ social media marketing through my
past internship experiences and I want to have a serious career in it. I believe in growing and
learning as I go ahead. I am a go-getter and a very output-driven person. There are not many
Jobs available in the market which a person will enjoy at the same time. I want to get into digital
marketing or social media marketing because I feel like I can do it. Currently I am working as a
content writer at DNP News Network Pvt Ltd. A candidate like me will ensure constant outputs
and team support wherever it will be needed.
I look forward to hearing from you.
