Hello¬†üëã¬†You can ask me anything about Fashion & Threads and I‚Äôll end up blabbering and oversharing
all the knowledge and love I have for them. (also by ‚Äòthreads‚Äô I mean the one that is used to sew or
make cloth and not the app) Furthermore, I am also the creative head of the clothing brand called √çosta
Clothing. In addition to it, I have also worked within brands such as Tata Trent Westside, Park Avenue,
Edeline Lee London etc.¬†

Life has taught me to always grow and adapt new skills and embrace opportunities. One can say that
I am an aspiring individual, who is self motivated, enthusiastic and extremely passionate about all
things Fashion. The whole process from researching, to actually getting an illustration to life, always
fascinated me, which made me pursue it as a career and since then I have never looked back.¬†

In my free time you might find me indulging in a good bowl of ramen (comfort food), spending a lot
of time on Netflix, as I love watching a good movie or captivating shows, hanging out with family
and friends, going for long walks, learning more about social media marketing and making reels on
Instagram to promote my business.¬†

Lastly, not to brag or anything, but I‚Äôm beyond polite, over friendly and always looking forward to an
insightful conversation so please feel free to reach out on anishav18@hotmail.com
