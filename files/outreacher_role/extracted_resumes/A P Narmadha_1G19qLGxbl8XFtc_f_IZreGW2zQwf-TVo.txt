  Academic Projects 

Title: User Query Analysis using Annotation Mining (U.G Project) 

Description: To provide a higher precision of image retrieval in search engines. We provide a novel method 
for the automatic  annotation of  images through relevance  between the keywords. We  introduce Markovian 
Semantic Indexing where the relevance between the keywords is analyzed. The precision in the  retrieval of 
images is more using the Markovian Semantic Indexing method. 

Title: Effect of Optical Confinement Factor in the Characteristics of Transistor Lasers (P.G Project) 

Description:  A  Transistor  laser  is  a  semiconductor  device  that  functions  as  a  transistor  with  an  electrical 
output and an optical output. The Quantum Well acts as an active region for laser emission. Then the effect 
of the quantum well number in the threshold current was analyzed. By fixing the number of quantum (two), 
and varying the thickness of the quantum well analysis of threshold current and current gain analyzed. 

Title: Live Price Prediction of NSEI Data using the ARMA Model 

Description: Creation of ARMA (Auto regressive moving Average Model) model that predicts the price for  
   the next day using one year of historical data from Yahoo Finance. The project is based on testing, training,  
   and showing the accuracy of the ARMA model.
