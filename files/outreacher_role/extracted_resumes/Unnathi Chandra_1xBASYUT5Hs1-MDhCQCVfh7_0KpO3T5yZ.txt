A B O U T   M E

I'm a recent graduate in BSc Mathematics, Statistics

and Computer Science. 

I am a creative problem-solver with strong

communication and team collaboration skills. 

I am always ready to take up new challenges to

broaden my skill set and contribute to innovative

projects. 

Some of my strengths would be working well under

pressure, being a good team player and being a fast

learner.
