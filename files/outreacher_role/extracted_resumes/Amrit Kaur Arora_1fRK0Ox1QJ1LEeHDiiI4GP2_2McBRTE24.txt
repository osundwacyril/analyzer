ABOUT ME

My name is Amrit Arora. I am a Content
Writer and a Content Strategist.

I'm a graduate in Finance, a Nutritionist by profession
and a writer at heart. You must be thinking, she's so
confused? 

But no, I firmly believe you can be good at more than
one thing in life and if you are good at something, you
should definitely pursue it.

I decided to pursue Nutrition because of my love for
Health, Wellness and Fitness. Writing had always been
my first love, but due to other projects in life, it took a
backseat.

Now, I'm all pumped up to date my first love again. So,
Let's see what all I have in store for you?

WHY YOU SHOULD THINK
ABOUT HIRING ME?

You just don't need perfect content, but
content which is personalised and
customised according to your
requirements.  

I create content which will actually leave
an impact on your audience and drive
them towards your brand just like bees.

I don't make you chase me for your
deliverables. Whether it's pizza or content,
we all demand fast delivery and I
understand that.  Keeping that in mind I
deliver my content within 48-72 hours. 

Still thinking? 
Go next to find what my clients say about
me.

I highly recommend Amrit Kaur as a content writer
at DocHome. Amrit consistently delivers high-
quality, engaging content that aligns perfectly
with our brand voice. She is professional,
collaborative, and always meets deadlines. I have
no doubt she will excel in any content writing role.

CLIENT REVIEW

Amrit was a pleasure to work with. initially, there
was a bit of communication error, which once
conveyed was like a breeze. Amrit writes very
ethically and professionally, very fast to work with
and believes in full client satisfaction. She
understands the type of dialogue that needs to be
written and then matches the tone of the
paragraph directly to the clients personality.
Would definitely recommend Amrit to everyone
looking for a good writer
