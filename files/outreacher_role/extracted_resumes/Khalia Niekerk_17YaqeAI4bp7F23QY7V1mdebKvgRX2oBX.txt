I am a 24-year-old professional from Johannesburg, South Africa, with three years 
of experience in social media marketing, writing, and copywriting. I hold a 
Bachelor of Arts degree, graduating cum laude in psychology and criminology, 
which enhances my ability to craft engaging, insightful content.

Currently, I am channeling my creativity into a jewelry business, designing and 
selling unique handcrafted pieces. This venture combines my passion for creativity 
with a therapeutic outlet.

My diverse skill set—spanning marketing, writing, and human behavior—enables 
me to excel in varied roles and adapt to new challenges. I am driven to reach my 
full potential and embrace exciting opportunities ahead.
