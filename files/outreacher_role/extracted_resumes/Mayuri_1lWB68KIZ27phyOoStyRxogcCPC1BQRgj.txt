Outreach Executive

In my role, I managed link-building campaigns for several clients. My daily

responsibilities included initiating email marketing link-building campaigns

based  on  thoroughly  researched  data.  I  also  engaged  with  webmasters

through  professional  platforms  like  LinkedIn  and  communication  channels

such  as  Slack.  My  primary  objective  was  to  acquire  high-quality  backlinks

using the A-B-C link-building method. Additionally, I oversaw on-page SEO

activities as part of my responsibilities.
