Swetha Anand

Industrial Designer

Hi! I'm a fourth year Undergraduate 

student from Symbiosis Institute of 

Design, looking for new opportuni-

ties in Industrial/Product Design to 

expand my knowledge.

For me, design is a constant loop of empathy, research and analysis. My approach towards a design 

problem is through research and user-centric analysis to create a meaningful experiance. I believe 

that minute details make a greater impact and thus, follow this ideology in my work.
