  Minor Project (Jan-March 2017) 

            Modelling of industrial chemical process with MATLAB and Simulink. 
            (Guided 

 Dr. Bharat Modhera, Head of Department, Chemical Department). 

Description - Model based design with MATLAB and Simulink has provided a cost-effective way to 
simplify and automate our design workflow by enabling chemical process engineers and controls engineers 
to work in the same environment.  

  Major Project (July-November 2017) 
      Production of high-quality petroleum products from Crude oil using ASPEN HYSYS. 

 Dr. Bharat Modhera, Head of Department, Chemical Department). 

(Guided 
Description - The aim of this project is to obtain higher yields of petroleum products by processing crude 
oil feed with similar properties as that used in the refineries using ASPEN HYSYS. 

  Major Project (January 

 April 2018) 

 Dr. Bharat Modhera, Head of Department, Chemical Department). 

Simulation analysis of a Propane Recovery Plant using ASPEN PLUS. 
(Guided 
  Description   A cryogenic plant is setup to recover propane, butane, and other heavier alkanes with two 
operating distillation columns; de-Methanizer and de-Ethanizer. The available software Aspen Plus is used to 
simulate this cryogenic plant to serve the purpose of recovery.
