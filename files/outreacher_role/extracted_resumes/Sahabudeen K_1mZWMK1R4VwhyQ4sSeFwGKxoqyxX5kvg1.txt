Project Work: 

  UG –Thermal analysis  of parabolic  trough with line concentrators. 

A parabolic trough is a type of solar thermal collector that is straight in one dimension 

and  curved  as  a  parabola  in  the  other  two,  lined  with  a  polished  metal  mirror.  The 

energy of sunlight which enters the mirror parallel to its plane of symmetry is focused 

along the focal line, where objects are positioned that is intended to be heated. 

  PG -Synthesis and characterization of Al 7150 alloy prepared by mechanical      

            milling method. 

The various ingredients of AI 7150 alloy were milled for a duration of  5h, 10 h and 

20  h  in  a  planetary  ball  mill  at  300  RPM  with  a  ball-to-powder  ratio  of  10:1.The 

blended  powders  were uniaxial  hot  pressed  at  400ºC  with  a  compaction  pressure of 

500  MPa.  The  holding  time  was  1  h.  The  hot  pressed  samples  developed  from, as-

received  AI  7150  alloy  powders  and  milled      (5  h,  10  h  and  20  h)  AI  7150  alloy 

powders  were  characterized  by  measuring  its  hardness,  relative  density  and 

electrochemical  behavior.  The  as-received  Al  7150  alloy  compacts  showed  lower 

hardness than that of the 5 h, 10 h or 20 h milled Al 7150 alloy compacts. 

Paper Presented At International Conferences:
