 I am a person who is enthusiastic, self-
motivated, dependable, and responsible. I
am a mature team player who can adapt
to any challenging situation and work on
my own. I have strong interpersonal skills
and am eager to learn and develop new
skills. I love working with data and want
to learn more and grow in that field.
Dancing and gaming are my hobbies, and
I love playing football, and undoubtedly, I
am the biggest Messi fan.
