PROJECTS

Uday Care Trust, Gurgaon, Haryana

 During my time volunteering at the dog shelter, I had the opportunity to actively engage
with paralyzed dogs, offering them love, care, and playtime. I found immense joy in
providing companionship and ensuring their well-being. Additionally, I supported the
shelter staff in various tasks, including assisting with vaccinations, administering
medications, and helping with general care and maintenance. It was a rewarding
experience to witness firsthand the positive impact of these efforts on the dogs' health
and overall happiness.
