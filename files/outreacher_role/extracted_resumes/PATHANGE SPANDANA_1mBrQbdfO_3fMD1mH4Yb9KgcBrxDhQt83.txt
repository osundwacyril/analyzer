PROJECTS 

PROJECT 1 

TITLE: FACE RECOGNITION” DESCRIPTION 

Domain : Machine Learning The main objective of this project is recognition of Face . It compares the face in front camera with that 
of captured earlier. It also shows the confidence level of user despite of variations, lighting and expressions. It compares various 
features like height, width of the face, nose, lips etc., and average color of the face(R,G,B) and so on. So that it can map out the 
above features in the image 

PROJECT 2 

TITLE: Brain Tumor Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network 

Domain: Machine Learning, HTML, CSS The challenging task of brain tumor segmentation in 2D MagneticResonance Brain 

Images (MRI), recognizing the limitations of manual classification and the complexities arising from diverse tumor appearances. 

The proposed methodology clustering algorithm for initial segmentation, followed by a comprehensive analysis employing 

traditional classifiers and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
