1.0  Engagement 

1.1  DWS hereby engages the Contractor to render the services, and deliver the reports, according to the schedule

Agreement and the annexed Exhibit A, this Agreement shall control. 

2.0  Compensation 

2.1

2.2  Contractor acknowledges and agrees that, except as provided in this Section 2, it shall not be entitled to, and 
the Company shall not be obligated to pay, any monies or other compensation for the Services provided and 
rights granted under this Agreement. 

3.0  Relationship of the Parties 

3.1  The Contractor agrees to perform the Services hereunder solely as an independent contractor. The Parties to 

this Agreement recognize that this Agreement does not create any actual or apparent agency, partnership, 
franchise, or relationship of employer and employee between the parties. The Contractor is not authorized to 
enter into or commit DWS to any agreements, and the Contractor shall not represent itself as the agent or legal 
representative of DWS. 

3.2  The Contractor shall not be entitled to participate in any of DWS’s benefits, including without limitation any 
health or retirement plans. The Contractor shall not be entitled to any remuneration, benefits, or expenses

acknowledges that the Services and the products thereof (hereinafter referred to as the "Materials") have been

necessary or desirable to evidence, establish, maintain, and protect DWS’s ownership of such Materials, and all 
other rights, title, and interest therein.

6.0  Confidentiality 

6.1  The Parties agree to provide the other with Confidential Information if needed to assist each Party in 

developing a business relationship. The Parties or one of them possess significant proprietary business 
methods, approaches, structures, and models which they wish to protect from disclosure. 

6.2  The term “Confidential Information,” as used in this Agreement, shall mean and include the identity of the 

principal parties to the Transaction and all written or printed information concerning data and reports relating 
to all aspects of each Party’s business, proprietary business methods, approaches, structures and models, 
financial statements, contracts, leases, policies of insurance, studies and opinions, and any other material 
relevant to the Transaction which is furnished to either Party by the other Party unless explicitly marked “not 
confidential.”  Additionally, all proprietary techniques, approaches, methods and structures, intellectual 
property, business know-how and other similar categories of information shall be deemed confidential 
information whether or not labeled as such.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Confidential 
Information” shall not include (a) information which is or becomes published or otherwise generally available 
to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement, (b) information which was available to either 
Party on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) information which 
becomes available to either Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the other Party. 

6.3  Each Party agrees (a) not to use or allow the use of any portion of the Confidential Information for any purpose 
except for the Transaction and any other purpose for which the Confidential Information is being provided 
under this Agreement, (b) not to disclose or allow disclosure to others of any portion of the Confidential 
Information except in connection with the purposes described in this Agreement and any other purpose for 
which the Confidential Information is being provided, and then only to principals of a Party, its agents, advisors, 
consultants, affiliates, representatives and employees (collectively “Representatives”), who are required to 
have access to such Confidential Information for purposes of evaluating the Transaction and each such Party 
shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure such Representatives abide by this Agreement, and (c) to obtain the 
written consent of the other Party prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information not otherwise permitted 
by this Agreement. When Representatives of a Party are given access to Confidential Information, the Party 
providing such access agrees to ensure the maintained confidentiality of the Confidential Information in the 
hands of such Representatives in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement. 

6.4  To the extent applicable, each Party shall keep a record of the files where the Confidential Information 

furnished is located. All copies of the Confidential Information will be returned to the other Party immediately 
upon the written request thereof. 

6.5  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this Agreement, each Party and its Representatives may 

disclose any portion of the Confidential Information, without the consent of the other Party, if requested or 
required to do so (a) pursuant to any federal or  state securities law, (b) pursuant to oral questions, 
interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or any order or 
demand in connection with any civil or criminal, judicial, administrative or congressional proceeding or similar 
process, or (c) where such disclosure or distribution is otherwise required by law or regulation.  In any event, 
each Party shall be entitled to disclose any portion of the Confidential Information to any person or entity for 
the purpose of enforcing rights against the other Party or any collateral securing any obligations created as a 
result of the proposed transaction being finalized. 

6.6  The obligations of the Parties and the protections established under this Agreement shall not be circumvented 

by mere technical compliance herewith.  Each Party agrees not to utilize any technique, process, formula, or 
manner of acting which would compromise the Confidential Information of the other Party even though such 
technique, process, formula, or manner of acting would otherwise be allowable under the terms of this 
Agreement.  Such non-circumvention shall survive termination of this agreement, in perpetuity. 

6.7  The obligations of each Party shall continue with respect to any item of Confidential Information for only so 

long as the item of Confidential Information retains its confidential or proprietary nature.
