Dear Sir/Madam 

My approach is to embed Corporate Social Investment and Responsibility, Project management, Stakeholder 
engagement within the value chain influencing responsible practice in all operations and touch points. My experience 
has given me insight into the dynamic sustainability challenges impacting business and society at present, and the 
opportunities to create mutual, planned, sustainable, and inclusive growth. By leveraging the collective resources of 
business and host communities i.e., people, skills, products, services, supply chain and opportunities, social and 
environmental justice license to operate can be derived. I am guided by principles of sustainability, fair trade, equity, 
enhancing local content and responsibility. 

Below are highlights of my experience: 
· Community Development strategy, policy, and programmes: I’m able to develop agile Community Development 
policy, strategy, plans and programmes, that not only respond to need, regulatory requirements, but attempts to 
undo the systemic nature of poverty and underdevelopment. 
Stakeholder and Regulatory management: The energy industry has multiple stakeholders. That afforded me an 
opportunity to work closely with stakeholders from community level to CEO and Ministerial, to secure permissions 
and get buy in for projects that need their support. For each project I would develop a Stakeholder Engagement Plan 
detailing key issue, reporting timelines, relationship managers and ensure stakeholders are timeously engaged. I 
have developed presentations and reports for strategic forums like the Dealer Roadshows, Employee Volunteerism 
projects and CEO Townhalls 
· Impact investing and Grant Management: I’m an experienced grant maker and impact investor. I’ve raised 
investment for key development initiatives, developed CSI/Foundation Grant Management and Governance 
frameworks, policies and procedures including online application and tracking tools; due diligence, monitoring & 
evaluation, partner selection, and proposal development & capacity building tools. 
I have experience in managing Trust projects and coordinating with different communities, partners, and funders, 
also managing Foundations. 
·Collaboration: Over the years I’ve developed several collaborations involving governments, private sector partners, 
international agencies, and NGOs. The collaborations create a platform for collective action enabling resources 
pooling, strategic alignment, transparency. The knowledge and resource sharing reduced duplication and allowed for 
projects to be scaled up with greater ease. 
· Team Management and capacity building: I’ve worked in a matrix organization. I have led teams that are 
multi-disciplinary, multi-cultural and multi- generational. I always ensure that I work with teams in an inclusive, 
transparent manner enabling innovation and contribution, recognition, and growth. 
· Employee Volunteering Programme: The VW Show of Hands Employee Volunteering programme was a key 
vector in placing sustainability and responsibility within each of the more than 25 000 employees. Through the 
training and volunteering opportunities we created incredible partnerships and intensified cohesion between host 
communities and business 
· Mass Giving Cause Marketing Campaigns: I developed and ran local community action campaigns with 
credible organisations like the KZN Children’s Hospital, Gift of the Givers and other local NGO’s and corporates. The 
collective action campaigns did a lot to create community cohesion and ownership of programmes. 
I strongly believe that I will be able to add value to your organisation and team.
