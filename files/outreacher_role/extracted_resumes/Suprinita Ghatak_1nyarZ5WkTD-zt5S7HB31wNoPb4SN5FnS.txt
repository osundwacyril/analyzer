PROJECT UNDERTAKEN AS A PART OF ACADEMIC CURRICULUM  

Project: “MICROCONTROLLER BASED DC MOTOR SPEED CONTROLLER”  
Review:         I have completed my project using 8052c microcontroller. This project is specially 
designed for controlling the speed of the DC motor using  eight push button switches. As we 
know  that  motion  control  plays  a  vital  role  in  industrial  automation  also  in  manufacturing 
industries  such  as  plastic  and  textile,so  this circuit  provides  a  perfect  motor  driver  which  can 
control the motor with just pressing the switches. This can also be used in treadmills and other 
flat belt applications
