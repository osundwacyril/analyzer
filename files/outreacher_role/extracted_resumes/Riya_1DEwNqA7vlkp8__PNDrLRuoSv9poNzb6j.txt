Research paper

Jan 2024 - May 2024

Topic: Dynamic Workload Prediction in a changing cloud
environment and allocate resources in real-time

This research paper presents a predictive system that
forecasts and adapts to changing workloads in cloud
environments. Using machine learning algorithms and
real-time monitoring, it predicts future workload
ﬂuctuations, allocating resources optimally to ensure
eﬃcient utilization, minimize latency, and improve overall
performance. This innovative approach reduces resource
waste, improves scalability, enhances user experience,
increases system reliability, and enables proactive
decision-making for better cloud resource management.
